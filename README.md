# Aliod-Bluetooth-WinMobile
Windows Mobile (.Net compact framework) program to communicate with Aliod-equipped L&amp;R gravity meter

Although no longer under development, this program is in use at the Arizona Water Science Center to view and log data output by the Aliod Feedback unit used with Lacoste & Romber gravity meters. The program reads the serial stream output on the DB9 serial port on the Aliod unit, sent to a Windows Mobile PDA using a Bluetooth "dongle" (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/retired/8495). 

The program, using .NET compact framework 3.5, requires Visual Studio 2008 to compile. The executable provided here should be usable on iPaq PDA's running Windows Mobile (it is currently in use on HP iPaq hx2400).
